# HTTP BasicAuth Broteforcer
Written in python to bruteforce password of admin user in my test environment.

You can change the username, URL, HTTP Method, Password file to your hearts content.

If you have the password then you can change the variable names around after modifying the positions in the `auth(user, password=pword)` to bruteforce just usernames

I may or maynot modify this script in the future to brute force usernames in a culsterbomb manner
